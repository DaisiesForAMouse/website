<p>
As a style preference, I'm going to drop all the arguments that are from the probability space.
</p>

<p>
Fix a probability space \((\Omega, \mathcal F, P)\); we characterize the Brownian motion \(\{B_t\}_{t \geq 0}\) via the follwing properties:
</p>
<ul>
<li>

<p>

<p>
Pick a probability space \((\Omega, \mathcal F, P)\) that is rich enough to support a countable collection of independent standard normal variables. If you are particular, the unit interval with Lesbegue measure is sufficient here.
</p>

<p>
The strategy is as follows: we define \(B_t\) for a countable dense set (in particular the dyadic rationals) of times using our precession of standard normals. then, we find some \(t \mapsto B_t\) that agrees on the dense set and is uniformly continuous and then extend by continuity.
</p>

<p>
Set \(D_n = \left\{ \frac{k}{2^n}, k = 0, 1, \dots, 2^n \right\}\) and \(D = \bigcup_{n=0}^\infty D_n\); index our standard normals by \(\{N_{q}\}_{q \in D}\), and set \(B_0 = 0, B_1 = N_1\), and \(B_{1/2} = \frac{B_1 - B_0}{2} + \frac{1}{2}N_{1/2}\). Just continue the same thing for every such dyadic, such that
</p>
\[
\{B_{1/2^n} - B_0, B_{2/2^n} - B_{1/2^n}, \dots, B_1- B_{(2^n-1) / 2^n} \}
\]
<p>
are all independent \(N\left(0, 2^{-n}\right)\). 
</p>

<p>
<span id="Brownian Motion and Stochastic Calculus-UChicago STAT 38510, Autumn 2023-Brownian Motion-Construction-Theorem"></span><strong id="Theorem">Theorem</strong>: Almost surely, \(t \mapsto B_t\), \(t \in D\) is uniformly continuous.
</p>

<p>
<em>Proof</em>: Set \(K_n = \sup \{ |B_s - B_t| \mid s,t \in D, |s - t| \leq 2^{-n}\}\). We just need to show that \(K_n \to 0\) as \(n \to \infty\). In fact, something even stronger is true: for \(\alpha &lt; \frac{1}{2}\), \(\lim_{n \to \infty} 2^{\alpha n}K_n = 0\). Morally speaking, just think that each Brownian increment is about its standard deviation, which is \(|t - s|^{1/2}\).
</p>

<p>
Technically, however, we proceed as follows: set
</p>
\[
  Y_n = \max\{B_{1/2^n} - B_0, B_{2/2^n} - B_{1/2^n}, \dots, B_1- B_{(2^n-1) / 2^n} \}
\]
<p>
and note that the union bound yields
</p>
\[
\begin{align*}
  P(Y_n \geq x) &amp;\leq \sum_{j=1}^{2^n} P(|B_{j/2^n} - B_{(j-1)/2^n}| \geq x) \\
      &amp;= 2^nP(B_{1/2^n} \geq x) \\
      &amp;= 2^{n+1}P(B_1 \geq 2^{n/2} x).
\end{align*}
\]
<p>
If we choose \(x_n\) such that \(\sum_{n=1}^\infty 2^{n+1}P(B_1 \geq 2^{n/2}x_n) &lt; \infty\), then by Borel-Cantelli shows that for sufficiently large \(n\), \(Y_n \leq x_n\) almost surely. Do any reasonable bound you like on the tail of the normal distribution and take a sufficiently large \(x\) and call it a day. In particular, if you choose the easiest bound \(P(N \geq x) \leq Ce^{-x^2/2}\), you can eventually get the bound:
</p>

<p>
<span id="Brownian Motion and Stochastic Calculus-UChicago STAT 38510, Autumn 2023-Brownian Motion-Construction-Prop"></span><strong id="Prop">Prop</strong>:
</p>
\[
  \limsup_{n \to \infty} \frac{2^{n/2}}{\sqrt{n}}Y_n \leq \sqrt{2 \log 2}.
\]

<p>
<em>Proof</em>: Look at the sum
</p>
\[
  \sum_{n=1}^\infty P\left(Y_n &gt; \sqrt{n} \cdot 2 ^{-n/2} \cdot \sqrt{2 \log 2 (1 + \epsilon)}\right)
\]
<p>
and apply Borel-Cantelli. In particular, we have
</p>
\[
\begin{align*}
  P(Y_n &gt; x_n) &amp;\leq \sum_{j=1^{2^n}} P(|B_{j/2^n} - B_{(j-1)/2^n}| &gt; x_n) \\
  &amp;= 2^{n+1}P(B_{1/2^n} &gt; x_n) \\
  &amp;= 2^{n+1}P\left(B_1 &gt; \sqrt{n} \sqrt{2(\log 2 (1 + \epsilon)}\right) \\
  &amp;\leq C 2^n e^{-\frac{\sqrt{2\log 2 n(1+\epsilon)^2}}{2}} \\
  &amp;\leq C e^{-n\epsilon}.
\end{align*}
\]

<p>
<span id="Brownian Motion and Stochastic Calculus-UChicago STAT 38510, Autumn 2023-Brownian Motion-Construction-Prop"></span><strong id="Prop">Prop</strong>: Set \(K_n = \sup \{ |B_s - B_t| \mid s,t \in D, |s - t| \leq 2^{-n}\}\); then, there is \(C\) such that with almost surely,
</p>
\[
  \limsup_{n \to \infty} \frac{2^{n/2}}{\sqrt{n}}K_n \leq C.
\]

<p>
<em>Proof</em>: It's easy to see that \(K_n \leq 2 \sum_{j=n+1}^\infty Y_j\) (this is just the triangle inequality). Then for sufficiently large \(n\), we get
</p>
\[
  K_n \leq 2 \cdot 2 \sum_{j=n+1}^\infty 2^{-j/2}\sqrt{j}
\]
<p>
with full probability, and so
</p>
\[
  \sup_{\substack{s, t \in D \\ s &lt; t}} \frac{|B_t - B_s|}{\sqrt{(t-s)|\log((t-s)^{-1})|}} &lt; \infty.
\]

<p>
Now we may set \(B_t\) for \(t \in [0, 1]\) by \(B_t = \lim_{\substack{s \to t \\ s \in D}}B_s\), and check that this is in fact a genuine Brownian motion, which is not bad; and of course this construction can extend to \([0, \infty)\) easily as well.

</p>

<p>
<em>Proof</em>: Assume \(|f'(t)| &lt; K\); there exists \(\delta &gt; 0\) such that if \(|s - t| \leq \delta\), \(|f(t) - f(s)| \leq 2K|s-t|\); in particular there is an \(N\) such that for all \(n &gt; N\), \(|s - t| \leq n^{-1}, |r - t| \leq n^{-1}\), \(|f(s) - f(r)| \leq 4Kn^{-1}\). Then, set 
</p>
\[
  Z_{k, n} = \max \left\{ |B_{k/n} - B_{(k-1)/n}|, |B_{(k+1)/n} - B_{k/n}|, |B_{(k+2)/n} - B_{(k+1)/n}|\right\}
\]
<p>
and
</p>
\[
  Z_n = \min \{ Z_{k, n} \mid k = 1, \dots, n \}.
\]

<p>
If \(B\) is differentiable, then there is some \(M\) such that \(Z_n \leq Mn^{-1}\) for all \(n\). Now set \(E_M\) to be the event that \(Z_n \leq Mn^{-1}\) for all sufficiently large; our theorem reduces to showing that \(P(E_M)  = 0\) for all \(M\). In fact, we will show that
</p>
\[
  \lim_{n \to \infty} P(Z_n \leq Mn^{-1}) = 0.
\]

<p>
Consider the union bound
</p>
\[
\begin{align*}
  P(Z_n \leq Mn^{-1}) &amp;\leq \sum_{j=1}^{n}P(Z(n,k) \leq Mn^{-1}) \\
  &amp;\leq nP\left( \max \left\{ |B_{1/n}|, |B_{2/n} - B_{1/n}|, |B_{3/n} - B_{2/n}|\right\}
\right) \\
&amp;\leq nP(|B_{1/n}| \leq Mn^{-1})^3 \\
&amp;\leq nP(|B_1| \leq Mn^{-1/2})^3
\end{align*}
\]
<p>
and just do literally the stupidest estimate you can, e.g. just look at the density and say that the probability is bounded by \(2CMn^{-1/2}\), so that the above is sent to zero as \(n \to \infty\).

</p>
\[
  \mathcal F_{\infty} = \bigcup_{t \geq 0} \mathcal F_t.
\]

<p>
<em>Def</em>: A stochastic process \(\{X_t \}_{t \geq 0}\) is adapted to \(\{ \mathcal F_t \}_{t \geq 0}\) if for each \(t\), \(X_t\) is \(\mathcal F_t\)-measurable.

<li>
\(B_0 = 0\),

<li>
\(\{ B_t \}_{t \geq 0}\) is adapted to \(\{ \mathcal F_t \}_{t \geq 0}\),

if \(s &lt; t\) then \(B_t - B_s\) is independent of \(\mathcal F_s\),

\(B_t - B_s \sim N(0, t-s)\),

and with probability 1 \(t \mapsto B_t\) is continuous.

</ul>

<em>Def</em>: A random variable \(\tau\) taking values in \([0, \infty]\) is called a stopping time with respect to \(\{ \mathcal F_t \}_{t \geq 0}\) if for every \(t\), the event \(\{\tau \leq t\} \in \mathcal F_t\).

<em>Def</em>: In general, if \(X_t\) is a stochastic process and \(\tau\) is a stopping time, both adapted to \(\{ \mathcal F_t \}_{t \geq 0}\) with \(P(\tau &lt; \infty) = 1\), then \(X_t\) has the <span id="Brownian Motion and Stochastic Calculus-UChicago STAT 38510, Autumn 2023-Brownian Motion-The Markov Property of Brownian Motion-strong Markov property"></span><strong id="strong Markov property">strong Markov property</strong> if \(X_{\tau + t}\) is independent of \(\mathcal F_{\tau}\).

\[
  Y_t = B_{\tau + t} - B_{\tau}.
\]
<p>
Then \(Y_t\)  is a Brownian motion independent of \(\mathcal F_t\), e.g. Brownian motion has the strong Markov property and the new process is also a Brownian motion.
</p>

<p>
<em>Proof</em>: You proceed by doing successive approximations.
</p>
<ul>

First, let \(\tau\) take a finite amount of values, and use the normal Markov property.

Then, approximate any \(\tau\) by stopping times taking a finite amount of values, such as by

Take a limit by continuity.

<p>
Then, one can see that if \(A \in \mathcal F_\infty\) and \(\epsilon &gt; 0\), there is \(n\) and \(A_n \in \mathcal F_n\) such that \(P(A_n \Delta A) &lt; \epsilon\); even better, there exists \(A_n\) independent of \(A \in \mathcal T_\infty\) such that \(P(A \Delta A_n) &lt; \epsilon\), and so we conclude that \(P(A) = P(A)P(A)\).

Let \(B_t\) be a standard Brownian motion; a partition \(\Pi\) of \([0, 1]\) is a sequence \(0 = t_0 &lt; t_1 &lt; \dots &lt; t_k = 1\), and the mesh of the partition is just
</p>
\[
  \| \Pi \| = \max_{i = 1, \dots, k} t_i - t_{i - 1}.

Now take a sequence of partitions \(\Pi_n\), e.g. \(0 = t_{0, n} &lt; \dots &lt; t_{k_n, n}\), and define the quantity
</p>
\[
  Q(t, \Pi) = \sum_{t_{j} &lt;= t} (B_{t_j} - B_{t_{j-1}})^2

</p>

<p>
<em>Proof</em>: A simple computation gives us that 
</p>
\[
  E(Q_n) = \sum_{j=1}^{k_n}E[(B_{t_j} - B_{t_{j-1}})^2] = \sum_{j=1}^{k_n}(t_j - t_{j-1}) = 1

Then,

\[

<p>
Recall that the second Borel-Cantelli lemma tells us that if they are independent and \(\sum_{n=1}^\infty P(A_n) = \infty\), then \(A_n\) occurs infinitely often with probability 1; this lemma is stronger than that.

is a tail event (e.g. in \(\mathcal T_\infty\)) and thus \(P(A_\epsilon) = 0\) or \(1\). In fact, if \(\epsilon &lt; 0\) then it's 0, and if \(\epsilon &gt; 0\) then it's 1. In fact, by this 0-1 law and symmetry one may see
</p>
\[
  P \left( \limsup_{t \to \infty} \frac{|B_t|}{\sqrt{2 t (1 + \epsilon) \log \log t}} \leq 1 \right) = P \left(\limsup_{t \to \infty} \frac{B_t}{\sqrt{2 t (1 + \epsilon) \log \log t}} \leq 1\right)

First take \(\epsilon &gt; 0\) and take some \(\rho &gt; 1\) to be specified later. Then, let

\[
  V_n = \left\{ |B_{\rho^n}| \geq \sqrt{2 \rho^n(1-\epsilon) \log \log \rho^n} \right\};

we want to to show that \(V_n\) occurs infinitely often. I claim that

\[
  P(V_{n+1} \mid V_1, \dots, V_n) \geq P \left( B_{\rho^{n+1}} - B_{\rho^n} \geq \sqrt{2 \rho^{n+1}(1-\epsilon) \log \log \rho^n} \right).
\]
<p>
To see this, compute
</p>
\[
\begin{align*}
  &amp;P \left( \frac{B_{\rho^{n+1}} - B_{\rho^n}}{\sqrt{\rho^{n+1} - \rho^n}} \geq \frac{\sqrt{2\rho^{n+1}(1-\epsilon)\log \log \rho^n}}{\sqrt{\rho^n (\rho - 1)}} \right) \\
  &amp;= P \left( \frac{B_{\rho^{n+1}} - B_{\rho^n}}{\sqrt{\rho^{n+1} - \rho^n}} \geq \sqrt{\frac{2 \rho}{\rho - 1}(1-\epsilon)(\log n + \log \log \rho)} \right) \\

<p>
and choose \(\rho\) large enough so that \(\frac{2 \rho}{\rho - 1}(1-\epsilon) &lt; 1\), and use the estimate \(P(B_1 &gt; x) \sim \exp(-x^2 / 2)\) and conclude by the earlier lemma. The other direction for \(\epsilon &lt; 0\) is similar (in fact, easier since we may conclude from the first Borel-Cantelli lemma).

<em>Def</em>: Set \(B_t\) a standard Brownian motion, \(Z = \{ t \mid B_t = 0 \}\), and \(Z_t = Z \cap [0, t]\). Then, \(t \in Z\) is right-isolated if \(t \in Z\), and \(\exists \epsilon &gt; 0\) such that \((t, t + \epsilon) \cap Z = \emptyset\); similar for left-isolated. A point which is both left and right isolated is just isolated.
</p>

<p>
With probability \(1\), \(0\) is not right-isolated; further, \(Z_1\) is homeomorphic to the Cantor set.
</p>

<p>
With probability 1, the sets of left and right isolated points are countable, and there are no isolated points.
</p>

<p>
We can show that if \(q \in \Q_{\geq 0}\), \(P(B_q  = 0) = 0\), and \(\tau_q = \min \{ t \geq q \mid B_t = 0\}\) is a stopping time; further, the left-isolated points are just \(\{ \tau_q \mid q \in \Q_{\geq 0}\}\). And by strong Markov property, no \(\tau_q\) is a right-isolated point, so there are no isolated points.
</p>

<p>
Set \(\sigma_q = \max_t \{ t &lt; q \mid B_t = 0 \}\) (this is well-defined, but not a stopping time). Then associate every \(q\) to an interval \((\sigma_q, \tau_q)\); then \(Z = [0, \infty) \setminus \bigcup_q (\sigma_q, \tau_q)\) and has Lesbegue measure 0. To see this, we just interchange integrals:
</p>
\[
  E[ \lambda(Z_1) ] = E\left[ \int_0^1 1_{\{B_s = 0\}} ds \right] = \int_0^1 P\{ B_s = 0 \}ds = 0.
\]

<p>
Look at \(Z \cap [1, 2]\); now cover \([1, 2]\) by intervals of length \(n^[-1]\); put the number of these intervals that intersect \(Z\) as \(X_n\). Then,
</p>
\[
  E[X_n] = \sum_{j=1}^n P\left(Z \cap \left[1 + \frac{j-1}{n}, 1 + \frac{j}{n}  \right]\neq \emptyset \right) \sim Cn^{1/2}.
