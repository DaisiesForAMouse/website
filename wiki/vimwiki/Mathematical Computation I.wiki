=== Linear Algebra Review ===

By convention, vectors are column vectors. 

Set $V$ a vector space (almost always real or complex).

_Def_: $\| \cdot \| : V \to \mathbb R$ is a *norm* if it satisfies the following properties:
- $\|v\| \geq 0$ for any $v \in V$,
- $\|v\| = 0$ iff $v = 0$,
- $\|\alpha v\| = |\alpha| \|v\|$ for $\alpha \in \mathbb R$ and $v \in V$,
- $ \|v + w\| \leq \|v\| + \|w\|$ for any $v, w \in V$.

Now, since this is a computational class, we only care about specific norms, almost all of which we can quickly qrite down. 

==== Vector Norms ====

Set $V = \mathbb R^n$ or $\mathbb C^n$ equivalently.

_Def_: The *Minkowski* or $p$*-norm* is given by
{{$
  \| x \|_p = \left(\sum_{i=1} x_i^p\right)^{1/p}
}}$
and we call the $2$-norm the *Euclidean norm* and the $1$-norm the *Manhattan norm*.

_Def_: The $\infty$*-norm* is the limit of $p$-norms as $p \to \infty$, and is given by
{{$
  \| x \|_\infty = \max_{i = 1, \dots, n} |x_i| = \lim_{p \to \infty} \| x \|_p.
}}$

_Def_: For a weight vector $\underline w = \begin{bmatrix}w_1, \dots, w_n\end{bmatrix}^T \in \mathbb R^n$, with each $w_i > 0$, we have that the *weighted* $p$*-norm* is
{{$
  \| v \|_{\underline w, p} = \left(\sum_{i=1} w_i x_i^p\right)^{1/p}.
}}$

_Def_: In general, for any positive definite matrix $A$ (that is, $x^TAx > 0$ for all $x \neq 0$), we may consider the *Mahalanobis norm*
{{$
  \| v \|_{A} = \left(x^T A x\right)^{1/2}.
}}$

As convention, the "default" norm when a subscript is omitted is the Euclidean norm.

==== Matrix Norms ====

Set $V = \mathbb R^{m \times n}$ or $\mathbb C^{m \times n}$ equivalently.

_Def_: The *Hölder* $p$*-norms* are given by
{{$
  \| X \|_{H, p} = \left(\sum_{i=1}^m\sum_{j=1}^m |x_{ij}|^p \right)^{1/p},
}}$
and the Hölder $2$-norm is called the Frobenius norm, which is also defined on infinite dimensional vector spaces as
{{$
  \| X \|_F = \left(\Tr(XX^*)\right)^{1/2}
}}$
where $^*$ is the conjugate transpose.

_Def_: As before, we can take $p \to \infty$ to get the *Hölder* $\infty$*-norm* given by
{{$
  \| X\|_{H, \infty} = \max_{\substack{i = 1, \dots n \\ j = 1, \dots, n}} |x_{ij}|.
}}$

_Def_: We can also define norms on matrices by viewing them as linear maps $A: \mathbb R^n \to \mathbb R^m$; in particular, if we have some norm $\| \cdot \|_a$ on $\mathbb R^n$ and some norm $\| \cdot \|_b$ on $\mathbb R^m$, we may define the *operator norm* (or *induced norm*)
{{$
  \| A \|_{a, b} = \max_{x \neq 0} \frac{\| A x \|_b}{\| x \|_a}.
}}$
In particular, if the norms on the domain and codomain are just $p$-norms, we write
{{$
  \| A \|_{p} = \max_{x \neq 0}\frac{\| A x\|_p}{\| x \|_p}
}}$
and call it the $p$*-norm* of $A$. In particular, we call the $2$-norm the spectral norm. Further, the $1$-norm and $\infty$-norm are just
{{$
  \| A \|_1 = \max_{j = 1, \dots, n} \left(\sum_{i=1}^m |a_{ij}| \right),
}}$
which is the max column sum, and
{{$
  \| A \|_\infty = \max_{i = 1, \dots, m} \left(\sum_{j=1}^n |a_{ij}| \right),
}}$
which is the max row sum; both facts are easy to check.

In general, for $p \notin \{1, 2, \infty\}$, computing $\| A \|_p$ is NP-hard, and if we consider $\| A \|_{p,q}$ then $\|A\|_{\infty, 1}$ is hard and $\|A\|_{1, \infty}$ is easy.

We may also want to consider some other desirable properties on our norms.
- For example, we might want *submultiplicativity*:
{{$
  \| A B\| \leq \|A \| \| B \|.
}}$
The Frobenius norm is submultiplicative.
- Take also *consistency*:
{{$
  \| Ax \|_b \leq \| A \|_{a,b} \|x\|_a.
}}$
= This is true for $p$-norms, but not in general. =
